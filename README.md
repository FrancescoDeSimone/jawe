# JAWE (Just Another Workflow Engine)

JAWE is a powerful and extensible Workflow Engine designed to manage workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It allows for the seamless integration of custom business logic through plugins, making it ideal for building complex workflows efficiently.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This project has been created for educational purposes. Feel free to explore and experiment with it, but it is not recommended for production use at this stage. The project is not stable and is not intended to be a production-ready product.

- Docker

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/jawe.git
cd jawe
npm install
```

### Running the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the JAWE engine and makes it ready for workflow execution.

To run the project, you need to have the Docker container with the database already up and running. Alternatively, you can use the following command to start everything together:

```bash
npm run start
```

This command installs the dependencies, starts the Docker containers using `docker-compose`, and runs the development server.
